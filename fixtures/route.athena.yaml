    text: The castle is part of a fortified architectural complex erected atop a limestone
      outcrop on the left bank of the Vistula River, at an altitude of 228 metres
      above sea level.[3][4] The complex consists of numerous buildings of great historical
      and national importance, including the Wawel Cathedral where Polish monarchs
      were crowned and buried. Some of Wawel's oldest stone buildings can be traced
      back to 970 AD, in addition to the earliest examples of Romanesque and Gothic
      architecture in Poland.[5][6] The current castle was built in the 14th century,
      and expanded over the next hundreds of years. In 1978 Wawel was declared the
      first World Heritage Site as part of the Historic Centre of Kraków.

    text: 'The Wawel Royal Castle (Polish pronunciation: [ˈvavɛl]; Zamek Królewski
      na Wawelu) and the Wawel Hill on which it sits constitute the most historically
      and culturally significant site in Poland. A fortified residency on the Vistula
      River in Kraków, it was established on the orders of King Casimir III the Great[2]
      and enlarged over the centuries into a number of structures around an Italian-styled
      courtyard. It represents nearly all European architectural styles of the Medieval,
      Renaissance and Baroque periods.'
