      very fond of architecture and always tries to protect it from damage. During
      that time she helped a young cobbler, named Dratewka. A few years before, an
      old and nasty dragon had settled in the cave inside the Wawel Hill.

Moreover, it portrays the significance of the capital of Poland in the operation of the Hanseatic League.

Numerous objects make it possible to imagine daily life in Kraków a few centuries ago. The exhibition shows, among others, mediaeval tools, historical coins, clay figures, decorations, dice and toiletry articles used over 600 years ago, together with the Tartar arrowheads, and beads and medallions from the Orient.

Standing 80 m tall, it is particularly famous for its wooden altarpiece carved by Wit Stwosz. Some of its monumental polychrome murals were designed by Poland's leading history painter, Jan Matejko. In 1978 it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the Historic Centre of Kraków.

The plaintive tune breaks off in mid-stream, to commemorate a famous 13th century trumpeter who was shot in the throat while sounding the alarm before a Mongol attack on the city. The noon-time hejnał is heard across Poland and abroad broadcast live by the Polish national Radio 1 Station.
