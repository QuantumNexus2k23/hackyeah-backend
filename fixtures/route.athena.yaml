    hero_story: Athena once came to the city of Cracow to admire the castle. She is
      very fond of architecture and always tries to protect it from damage. During
      that time she helped a young cobbler, named Dratewka. A few years before, an
      old and nasty dragon had settled in the cave inside the Wawel Hill.

      na Wawelu) and the Wawel Hill on which it sits constitute the most historically
      and culturally significant site in Poland. A fortified residency on the Vistula
      River in Kraków, it was established on the orders of King Casimir III the Great[2]
      and enlarged over the centuries into a number of structures around an Italian-styled
      courtyard. It represents nearly all European architectural styles of the Medieval,
      Renaissance and Baroque periods.'

    text: The Rynek Underground is one of the youngest Cracow’s museums. Modern and keeping up with the new standards, but perfectly recreating atmosphere of the city existing in the previous centuries. The main exhibit “In the Footsteps of Krakow’s European Identity” was launched three days after the museum's opening. It uses holograms constructed by using projectors, alongside fog machines and screens.

    text: The Rynek Underground exhibition presents not only Cracow’s rich history, but also the connections between the city and mediaeval Europe’s chief centres of trade and culture. Moreover, it portrays the significance of the capital of Poland in the operation of the Hanseatic League. The real historical objects on display, just to mention 14th-century coins, decorations, and pottery, are proof of the European cultural and trade exchange that continued here incessantly for hundreds of years.

Another curio is the preserved stretches of transport routes, which provide an idea of what the mediaeval technology of road building was. Numerous objects make it possible to imagine daily life in Kraków a few centuries ago. The exhibition shows, among others, mediaeval tools, historical coins, clay figures, decorations, dice and toiletry articles used over 600 years ago, together with the Tartar arrowheads, and beads and medallions from the Orient.

The plaintive tune breaks off in mid-stream, to commemorate a famous 13th century trumpeter who was shot in the throat while sounding the alarm before a Mongol attack on the city. The noon-time hejnał is heard across Poland and abroad broadcast live by the Polish national Radio 1 Station.
