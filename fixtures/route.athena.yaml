    hero_story: Athena once came to the city of Cracow to admire the castle. She is
      very fond of architecture and always tries to protect it from damage. During
      that time she helped a young cobbler, named Dratewka. A few years before, an
      old and nasty dragon had settled in the cave inside the Wawel Hill.

    text: 'The Wawel Royal Castle (Polish pronunciation: [ˈvavɛl]; Zamek Królewski
      na Wawelu) and the Wawel Hill on which it sits constitute the most historically
      and culturally significant site in Poland. A fortified residency on the Vistula
      River in Kraków, it was established on the orders of King Casimir III the Great[2]
      and enlarged over the centuries into a number of structures around an Italian-styled
      courtyard. It represents nearly all European architectural styles of the Medieval,
      Renaissance and Baroque periods.'
