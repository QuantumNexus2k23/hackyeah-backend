      Athena once came to the city of Cracow to admire the castle. She is very fond of architecture and always tries to protect it from damage. During that time she helped a young cobbler, named Dratewka. A few years before, an old and nasty dragon had settled in the cave inside the Wawel Hill. The dragon terrified local villagers by eating up their cattle and threatened to destroy the castle. It promised to stop only if given

      Smocza Jama has two entrances, one natural and one artificial — a 19th-century waterwork well. 
      They are connected by three large chambers. A side passage, discovered in 1974,
      leads under the St. Stanislaus and St. Wenceslaus's Cathedral.
      In the underground pools lives a rare crustacean troglobiont, Niphargus tatrensis, relict of the Tertiary sea fauna.

      Located on the Vistula River south of Wawel, Skałka was part of the
      island city of Kazimierz until the nineteenth century, when the Old Vistula River was filled in.
      The original church was built in the Romanesque style. King Casimir III replaced it
      with a Gothic church, and since 1472 that shrine has been in the possession of a monastic
      community of Pauline Fathers. In 1733-51 the church received a Baroque decor.
      It is one of the most famous Polish sanctuaries.

      In Yiddish it was referred to as the Alta Shul. 
      It is the oldest synagogue building still standing in Poland,
      and one of the most precious landmarks of Jewish architecture in Europe. 
      Until the beginning of the Second World War in 1939, it was one of the city's most important synagogues 
      as well as the main religious, social, and organizational centre of the Kraków Jewish community.
      The Synagogue was built in 1407 or 1492; the date of building varies with several sources. 
      The original building was rebuilt in 1570, by the Italian architect Mateo Gucci.
